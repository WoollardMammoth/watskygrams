# watskygrams
A fun project regarding wordplay inspired by the trio of albums released by artist George Watsky.

On January 11, 2019, Watsky released his fifth album, COMPLAINT. COMPLAINT would later exist to be part of a 3 part album series, joined by 2020's PLACEMENT and 2023's INTENTION.

Together, the titles of the three albums join them together as one cohesive project.

This raised the question, "How many word-triplets could Watsky have chosen to have created a project like this?" Which this project sought to answer.
